## Abstract
For our group IT-Project at the [University of Applied Science Georg Simon OHM](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/en/faculties/in/) we built a website that is capable of suggesting recipe ideas to the user that are tailored to his needs. For this purpose, the diet style (e.g. vegetarian or vegan), the intolerances (e.g. gluten intolerances or intolerances to peanuts), the foods available in the household and the daily calorie target are taken into account. Based on this input, the website generates a diet plan tailored to the users needs. This diet plan provides the user with a personalized recipe for each of the usual three daily meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner). If the user does not like one of these recipes, he is able to have a new one suggested to him by means of a "reroll function". Furthermore, the user is able to get a quick overview of the contained nutritional values, possibly missing ingredients and a printout of the recipe list.

## Getting started
Clone this repository and start your prefered webserver (e.g [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html)), move the repository under htdcos and call ```localhost/IT-Projekt/index/index.html ```. Standard port is 3306 (can be adjusted under shared -> php -> config.php).<br>
Furthermore a database is needed. If you are using XAMPP, go to ```http://localhost/phpmyadmin/```, create a new database with the name ```individumeal_comdb1```, click on import and then choose the sql file ```individumeal_comdb1.sql``` provided in this repository.
